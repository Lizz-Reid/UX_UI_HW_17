            <P>Design has always been my passion, but finding the perfect fit has been a journey. In a graphic and product design course, I discovered joy in the design process and psychology.
                I then detoured into architecture which still did not feel right, yet it revealed my love for working within design briefs. This exploration naturally led me to the exciting world of UI/UX design, where all my design interests seamlessly come together. I am grateful for my previous design opportunities that gave me a well-rounded approach to design.</P>
